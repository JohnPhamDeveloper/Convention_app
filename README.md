## Language & Framework

* Built with the programming language **Dart** (required for flutter)
* Used **Firestore** as a database
* **Flutter** as a framework

## Prior experience 

Zero prior experience with flutter, dart, and firestore. Learned as I worked on project.

## Summary of project

This is a personal project done in my own free time away from school. The following are the objectives of the project:

* Connect people who go to anime/cartoon/superhero conventions
* Allow users to request "Selfies" from other users nearby (take a quick picture with each other)
* Allow users to request "Hangouts" from other users nearby (drink, party, or explore convention together)
* Allow users to request photography services from nearby photographers
* Allow users to see other users who they are matched with on a map (integrated in the app)
* Users can recieve 'Friendliness' ratings from other users. Conventions usually have sexual harrassment problems and this can help people find others who are trustworthy.
* Users can recieve 'Fame' ratings based on number of selfies taken.
* Be able to message users they match with
* Recieve notifications for messages, matches, or any other necessary alerts

## Who are the intended demographics?

The demographics of this project was targeted towards anyone who attends or plans to attend cosplay conventions. Cosplay conventions generally have contents such as anime, cartoons, or superheros. The three types of people I target at conventions are:

* Congoers - Attends the convention in casual clothing
* Photographers - Attends the convention as a professional or amateur photographer
* Cosplayers - Attends the convention in a costume
