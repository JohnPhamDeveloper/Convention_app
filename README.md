## Summary of project

This is a personal project done in my own free time away from school. The objective of the project is as followed:
* Connect people who go to anime/cartoon/superhero conventions
* Allow users to request "Selfies" from other users nearby (take a quick picture with each other)
* Allow users to request "Hangouts" from other users nearby (drink, party, or explore convention together)
* Allow users to request photography services from nearby photographers
* Allow users to see other users who they are matched with on a map (integrated in the app)
* Be able to message users they match with
* Recieve notifications for messages, matches, or any other necessary alerts
